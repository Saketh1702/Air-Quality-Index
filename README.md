# Air-Quality-Index

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Indian cities using machine learning techniques. The challenge lies in the dynamic and unpredictable nature of air pollution, making consistent monitoring and analysis crucial for understanding its impact on humans, animals, plants, climate, and the environment.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The project sourced relevant air pollution data from Kaggle, covering a five-year period for Indian cities.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Conducted a thorough data cleaning process, addressing duplicate records and handling null values to ensure the integrity of the dataset.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Utilized Seaborn heat maps and other visualization techniques to analyze the data's behavior before addressing any missing values.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Trained the data using a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Support Vector.

5. **Results Analysis:**
   - Evaluated model performance using coefficients of determination and root mean squared error.
   - Visualized and interpreted results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Technologies Used

- **Numpy:** Facilitated numerical operations within the project.
- **Pandas:** Played a crucial role in data manipulation and analysis.
- **Sklearn:** Implemented machine learning models for prediction tasks.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Provided tools for effective data visualization.
- **Xgboost:** Applied for gradient boosting, contributing to enhanced model performance.

## Technology Selection

The chosen technologies were based on a deliberate decision-making process:
- Opted for manual visualization tools to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation.
- Experimented with various models and selected the top four for a comprehensive comparison.
- Limited familiarity with certain technologies influenced the final choice.

## Challenges Faced

- **Data and Project Flow:** Difficulty in finding suitable data and establishing a coherent project flow, leading to a two-day exploration period.
- **Overfitting Issues:** Encountered instances of 100% accuracy, indicating overfitting; necessitated a re-evaluation of features.

## Overcoming Challenges

- **Data Research:** Proactively researched and found relevant data on Kaggle to address data-related challenges.
- **Seeking Guidance:** Reached out to seniors and batchmates for insights and guidance, particularly in understanding the project flow.
